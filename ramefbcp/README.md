Secondary LCD display framebuffer updating for RamePlayer
---------------------------------------------------------

What's shown on the screen:

* Thumbnail-sized image of playing video on the small LCD screen
* Current play position visualization (thin red horizontal bar)
* Playing status with an icon (Play / Pause / Stop / Buffering)
* Play time & length (shorthand for formatting row with time int values)
* Given text from backend: (generic, but examples below)
  - Filename of current media
  - IP address
  - Hostname
  - "Restart Pending..." info
  - ...
* Too long text rows are auto-scrolled back and forth automatically


TODO:
- (support for other than 16bpp fb pixel formats - if needed?)
